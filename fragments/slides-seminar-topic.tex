%The slides generally cover the topic in a good way, but I do like to see more numerical examples to show the audience how the concepts work, how it is done in practice and to make it more tangible. Are you able to show a live demon (e.g., with colab)?

\subsection{Why do we need word embedding}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Introduction}

\begin{center}
	\textit{Word embeddings are one of the few currently successful applications of unsupervised learning. Their main benefit arguably is that they do not require expensive annotation, but can be derived from large unannotated corpora that are readily available. Pre-trained embeddings can then be used in downstream tasks that use small amounts of labeled data.}
